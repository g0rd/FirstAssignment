For Assignment #9 I created a programatic presentation of the quotes from the Guardian Heroid Addict Example.

The styling is used from the Guardian page as well. 
The data is gathered as JSON and put in a separate file. 

The purpose of the assignment was to understand the HTML injection through jQuery.

I struggled with it for a little bit in order to understand the syntax of document.onready and jquery append().
After understanding the syntax it was an easy task just setting the tags right and doing the styling using the template.
